# RShiny-app saeforhealth (WHO)

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This RShiny app facilitates the mapping of health indicators prevalence using data from Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS). Powered by the R package SurveyPrev, our Shiny app revolutionizes the acquisition of prevalence estimates through Small Area Estimation (SAE) techniques. It is tailored for users of all backgrounds, enabling the performance of complex statistical analyses without prior knowledge spatial data management or modelling.

The application streamlines the analytical process into clear, manageable steps. It guides users through model fitting and enhances their experience with interactive visualization tools. Users can dynamically explore the spatial distribution of health and demographic indicators and directly interpret statistical outputs within the appâ€™s interface. Additionally, the application supports result exports, facilitating detailed examinations and sharing in both spreadsheet and graphical formats.

## Installation


Some non-CRAN dependencies can be installed using the following command. We strongly recommend installing the most recent version of SUMMER and surveyPrev package from Github. 

``` {r, eval=F, echo=T}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("rspatial/geodata")
devtools::install_github("richardli/SUMMER")
devtools::install_github("richardli/surveyPrev")
devtools::install_github("statnmap/HatchedPolygons")
install.packages("INLA",repos=c(getOption("repos"),
                        INLA="https://inla.r-inla-download.org/R/testing"),dep=TRUE)
```



You can then install the development version of saeforhealth with:

``` {r, eval=F, echo=T}
devtools::install_github("wu-thomas/saeforhealth-WHO")
```

## Launch the app

You can launch the Shiny app with the following command:
